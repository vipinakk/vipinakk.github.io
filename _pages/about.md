Hello! I am an Associate Research Scientist at the Yale School of Medicine, Section of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS) working with [Dr. Hua Xu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hua-xu/). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale BIDS and before that a Postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from Ying Wu College of Computing, New Jersey Institute of Technology co-advised by [Dr. James Geller](https://web.njit.edu/~geller/) and [Dr. Yehoshua Perl](https://web.njit.edu/~perl/). Prior to that I worked as an assistant lecturer at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India.

My research interests lie broadly in the domain of biomedical ontologies/terminologies and clinical and biomedical natural language processing.
