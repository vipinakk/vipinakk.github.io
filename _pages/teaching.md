# NJIT Ying Wu College of Computing

## Spring 2021

[CS 114](https://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/computing-sciences/computer-science/#coursestext) Introduction to Computer Science II - A study of advanced programming topics with logical structures of data, their physical representation, and the design of computer algorithms operating on the structures. Course covers program specifications, correctness and efficiency, data abstraction, and algorithm analysis. (Level: Undergrad)

[CS 632](https://web.njit.edu/~geller/632/syllabus2020springV12.htm) Advanced Database Systems Design - An advanced course on databases covering topics such as programming in PL/SQL, OODBs, DB security, Indexing, and Buffer tuning. An introduction to No-SQL databases, especially MongoDB, various formats including XML and JSON and an overview of the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) of data. (Level: Graduate)

## Spring 2019, Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Fall 2020

[CS 116](https://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/computing-sciences/computer-science/#coursestext) Introduction to Computer Science II in C++ - A study of advanced programming topics with logical structures of data, their physical representation, design and analysis of computer algorithms operating on the structures, and techniques for program development and debugging. Course covers program specifications, correctness and efficiency, data abstraction, basic aspects of simple data structures, internal searching and sorting, recursion and string processing. Algorithmic analysis is also discussed. (Level: Graduate)

## Fall 2018

[CS 103](https://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/computing-sciences/computer-science/#coursestext) Computer Science with Business Problems - An introductory course in computer science, with applications to business and managerial decision making. Topics include basic concepts of computer systems, software engineering, algorithm design, programming languages and abstraction, with applications. (Level: Undergrad)

[CS 106](https://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/computing-sciences/computer-science/#coursestext) Roadmap to Computing for Engineers - An introduction to programming and problem solving skills for engineering majors using Python programming languages. Topics include basic strategies for problem solving, constructs that control the flow execution of a program and the use of high level data types such as lists, strings, and dictionaries in problem representation. The course also presents an overview of selected "big idea" topics in computing. (Level: Undergrad)

## Spring 2018

[CS 634](https://web.njit.edu/cs734/634syllabus.html) Data Mining - This course covers the principles of data mining system design and implementation. It presents methods for association and dependency analysis as well as classification, prediction, and clustering. Optional topics may include time series and graph mining, current trends in data mining, and data mining for scientific, medical and engineering applications. (Level: Graduate)

## Fall 2017

[CS 103](https://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/computing-sciences/computer-science/#coursestext) Computer Science with Business Problems - An introductory course in computer science, with applications to business and managerial decision making.
